ucsc-spheral-scripts
====================

Python scripts for driving spheral simulations  
Contents: 
  * `SphereImpact-3d.py` - original Owen script, for reference (with minor bug fixes and mods)
  * `collision_in_strength_regime.py` - Two spheres colliding with strength and damage, no gravity 
  * `fujiwara.py` - Modeling the Nakamura Fujiwara (1991) experiment 
  * `equations_of_state` - Demonstrating the construction and usage of EOS objects 
  * `gravity_collapse` - Homogeneous planet collapsing under self gravity (WARNING NOT FINISHED) 
  * `load_interactive_spheral` - Just the `import` commands to bring spheral classes to the local namespace, for interactive exploration. Works best with iPython.
