Testing stability, accuracy, and performance
==============================================

  * `NakamuraFujiwara.py` [mostly working]  
    * TODO: currently only Tillotson is implemented  
    * TODO: check artificial viscosity and other hydro  
    * TODO: add post-run diagnostics  
  
  * `polytropic_planet` [in development, do not use!]  
    * Still explodes for no reason
